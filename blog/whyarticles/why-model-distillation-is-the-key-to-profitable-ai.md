## 🚀 The Economic Challenge of AI Hardware
AI toys and companion robots represent a massive market opportunity, but they face a harsh reality: **cloud computing costs**. Running large, unoptimized models via the cloud destroys product margins and creates latency that ruins user experience.

To make AI hardware viable for the mass market, the intelligence must be moved to the "edge"—directly onto the hardware.

## 🛠️ What is Model Distillation?
Model distillation allows us to take a "teacher" model (a large, complex LLM) and train a "student" model (a lightweight, efficient version) that retains the core intelligence but requires a fraction of the computational power.

At **EdgeSOM**, we specialize in **[LLM Training & Model Distillation Services](https://www.edgesom.com/products_8/llm-training-model-distillation-services.html)**. This process enables:
* **Lower BOM Costs**: Running AI on $5-$10 domestic chipsets instead of expensive processors.
* **Privacy & Speed**: Millisecond response times with offline edge computing.
* **Emotional Engagement**: Balancing technical efficiency with warm, relatable interaction logic.

## 🧘 Empathy at Scale
Our algorithms aren't just efficient; they are built with deep emotional resonance. We ensure that distilled models for companion robots maintain the necessary logic to support users effectively while remaining computationally light.

## 🏗️ Your Partner for Mass Production
EdgeSOM bridges the gap between algorithm design and ISO-certified manufacturing. We help startups move from concept to reality with a production barrier starting at only **$5,000 USD**.
